- When inserting a 25-cent coin (coin=3) from state S0, there's no change issued when a product is dispensed

2. State Transition Anomalies:
- At timestamp 10000-25000: When inserting multiple 10-cent coins (coin=2), the state correctly progresses from S0->S10->S20, but doesn't handle overflow properly
- At timestamp 50000-75000: With 25-cent coins (coin=3), the state gets stuck at S25 (state=5) until another coin triggers dispense

3. Dispense Logic Issues:
- The dispense signal works correctly in triggering when reaching or exceeding the required amount
- However, it's not properly coordinated with change dispensing for overflow situations
