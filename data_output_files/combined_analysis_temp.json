Let's analyze the expected behavior versus the observed behavior:\n\n1. **Expected Behavior of XOR Gate:**\n   - The output `out` should be `1` when inputs `a` and `b` are different (i.e., one is `1` and the other is `0`).\n   - The output `out` should be `0` when inputs `a` and `b` are the same (i.e., both are `0` or both are `1`).\n\n2. **Observed Behavior:**\n   - At timestamp 0, `a = 0`, `b = 0`, the output `out` is `0`. This is correct.\n   - At timestamp 10000, `a = 0`, `b = 1`, the output `out` is `1`. This is correct.\n   - At timestamp 20000, `a = 1`, `b = 0`, the output `out` is `1`. This is correct.\n   - At timestamp 30000, `a = 1`, `b = 1`, the output `out` is `0`. This is correct.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The waveform data at each timestamp matches the expected XOR logic output except for the verdict given. Upon re-evaluation, it turns out that the initial conclusion of \"ANO",

Count Signal Behavior:\n- The count signal appears to be empty/undefined for most of the simulation\n- It only shows a value of 10 at timestamp 105000\n- A properly functioning counter should show regular increments on clock edges\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n- The reset signal (rst) starts at 1 and then goes to 0 at 10000\n- While this initial reset is correct, we don't see the expected count initialization to 0 followed by increments\n\n4. Expected vs Actual:\n- For a 4-bit counter, we should see:\n  * Clear initialization to 0 when rst=1\n  * Regular increments from 0 to 15 (4'b0000 to 4'b1111) on clock edges\n  * Continuous counting pattern when rst=0\n- Instead, we see mostly undefined values with a single count value\n\nThis behav",

This indicates the STOP bit is not transmitted. The `STOP` state is defined but never reached due to the bug, which causes the UART transmission to be incomplete.\n\n2. **State Transition Issues:**\n   - At timestamp 35000, the transition from `state 1` (START) to `state 2` (DATA) is correct. However, `busy` should remain 1 until the transmission is fully complete, including the STOP bit.\n   - At timestamp 115000, `busy` is set to 0, and the state goes back to `IDLE` without transmitting a STOP bit, as seen from the waveform data showing `tx` toggling without the expected STOP bit phase.\n\n3. **Signal Behavior:**\n   - The `tx` signal is changing between 0 and 1 during `DATA` state, but it transitions back to 1 (indicat",

This is a bug because the zero flag should be set to 1 when the result of an operation is zero. In the waveform data, for example, at timestamp 20000, the result is `00`, which should set the zero flag to 1, but it remains 0.\n\n2. **Operation 001 (Subtraction) Anomaly**: At timestamp 10000, with `op` as 00",

This is consistent with the zero flag bug.\n\n3. **Carry Flag Handling**: The carry flag is only calculated for addition and subtraction (when `op` is 000 or 001). For other operations, the carry flag is set to 0 (`if (op > 3'b001) carry = 0;`). This is correct behavior as logical operations do not typically involve carry.\n\n4. **Shift Right Operation (op 111) Anomaly**: At times",
