Output `out` is `1`, as expected since a NAND gate outputs `1` when at least one input is `0`.\n\n- At timestamp 10000: Inputs are `a=0`, `b=1`. Output `out` is `1`, which is correct. The NAND gate outputs `1` when at least one input is `0`.\n\n- At timestamp 20000: Inputs are `a=1`, `b=0`. Output `out` is `1`, as expected for the same reason as above.\n\n- At timestamp 30000: Inputs are `a=1`, `b=1`.

The output (out) is only following input 'a' and completely ignoring both input 'b' and the select signal 'sel'. This is evident from the code where `assign out = a;` directly connects output to input 'a'.\n\n2. Looking at the waveform data:\n   - At t=0: sel=0, a=0, b=1, out=0 (Correct for sel=0)\n   - At t=10000: sel=1, a=0, b=1, out=0 (INCORRECT - should be 1 when sel=1)\n   - At t=20000: sel=0, a=1, b=0, out=1 (Correct for sel=0)\n   - At t=30000: sel=1, a=1, b=0, out=1 (INCORRECT - should be 0 when sel=1)\n\n3. A correct 2:1 multiplexer should implement:\n   - When sel=0: out should equal a\n   - When sel=1: out should equal b\n\nThe correct implementation should be:\n```verilog\nassign out = (sel) ? b : a;\n```\n\nThe current implementation is stuck always following input 'a', making it non-functional as a multiplexer.
