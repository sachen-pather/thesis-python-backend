The 3-input AND gate (and3) is functioning exactly as expected based on the waveform analysis:

1. At t=0ns:
   - Inputs: a=0, b=0, c=0
   - Output: out=0 (correct for AND gate with any 0 inputs)

2. At t=10ns:
   - Inputs: a=1, b=1, c=0
   - Output: out=0 (correct because not all inputs are 1)

3. At t=20ns:
   - Inputs: a=1, b=1, c=1
   - Output: out=1 (correct because all inputs are 1)

The behavior perfectly matches the expected truth table for a 3-input AND gate where:
- Output is only 1 when ALL inputs (a, b, and c) are 1
- Output is 0 in all other cases

The output transitions appropriately in response to input changes, and there are no stuck signals or unexpected behaviors. The combinational logic is implementing the specified AND3 function correctly through the assign statement `out = a & b & c`.",1.5,3.423398017883301,4.923398017883301

   - At timestamp 0, the reset (`rst`) is high, and the output `q` is set to `0001`. This is consistent with the design code where `q` is initialized to `4'b0001` upon reset.

2. **Sequential Behavior:**
   - After the reset is deasserted (rst goes to 0 at timestamp 10000), the output `q` begins to change according to the LFSR logic.
   - The sequence of values observed in `q` (0001, 0010, 0100, 1001, 0011, 0110, 1101, 1010, 0101, 1011, 0111, 1111, 1110, 1100, 1000, 0001) is consistent with an LFSR driven by the feedback polynomial determined by `q[3] ^ q[2]`.

2. Pulse Width Timing Issue:
- Based on the design, the pulse should remain high for 4 clock cycles (counter starting at 3'b100 and counting down)
- In the waveform, the pulse remains high from 25000 to 75000 (50000 time units) and 85000 to beyond 90000
- This is much longer than expected given the counter should only count down from 4 to 0

3. Counter Reset Issue:
- The pulse doesn't properly reset when trigger goes low
- At t=30000, trigger goes low but pulse remains high until t=75000
- This suggests the counter isn't properly decrementing or the pulse isn't correctly clearing

   - At timestamp 105000, `count` is correctly shown as 10, and `overflow` is 0. However, at timestamp 115000, `overflow` is 1, which is expected because the counter should reset to 0 and set `overflow` to 1 when `count` reaches 10. But at the next timestamp, 125000, `overflow` is back to 0, which is correct post-reset but lacks clarity on intermediate steps due to the missing `count` values.

   - According to the design code, there is a direct transition from the `DATA` state to the `IDLE` state when `bit_idx` reaches 7. This indicates the STOP bit is not transmitted. The `STOP` state is defined but never reached due to the bug, which causes the UART transmission to be incomplete.

2. **State Transition Issues:**
   - At timestamp 35000, the transition from `state 1` (START) to `state 2` (DATA) is correct. However, `busy` should remain 1 until the transmission is fully complete, including the STOP bit.
   - At timestamp 115000, `busy` is set to 0, and the state goes back to `IDLE` without transmitting a STOP bit, as seen from the waveform data showing `tx` toggling without the expected STOP bit phase.

   - The `tx` signal is changing between 0 and 1 during `DATA` state, but it transitions back to 1 (indicat",1.5,10.178147792816162,11.678147792816162

- The tx signal toggles between 0 and 1 during the DATA state, but without maintaining proper bit timing
- A proper UART should maintain consistent bit timing throughout the frame
