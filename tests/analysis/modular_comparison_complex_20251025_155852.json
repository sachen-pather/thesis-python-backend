However, the carry flag should not be manually reset in this manner for bitwise operations, as they do not naturally produce a carry, which can lead to confusion. For example, at timestamp `20000`, the addition (`op = 000`) results in a carry (`C = 1`) which is correct, but this logic prevents ac",
