Overflow Behavior:\n- The overflow signal stays at 0 for most of the simulation\n- It only pulses to 1 once at timestamp 105000\n- Given that this is a mod-10 counter (0-9), we should see the overflow signal pulse high more frequently (every 10 clock cycles)\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n- Reset (rst) starts at 1 and then goes to 0 at 10000\n- While this initial reset behavior is correct, we can't verify if it properly initialized the counter since count values are missing\n\n4. Expected vs Actual Behavior:\n- For a mod-10 counter with the given clock period, we should see:\n  * Counter cycling through values 0-9\n  * Overflow pulsing every 10 clock cycles\n  * Instead, we see very infreque",

Reset Functionality:\n- Reset works correctly at t=0, initializing q to 4'b0000\n\n2. Loading Issues:\n- At t=10000, load=1 and data=1010, but q remains at 0000\n- The design is missing logic to handle the load signal and load the data input\n- The Verilog code only implements shift register functionality without the load feature\n\n3. Shift Register Operation:\n- The shift register part works correctly:\n  - When din=1, bits shift left with 1 entering LSB (q: 0000->0001->0011->0111->1111)\n  - When din=0, bits shift left with 0 entering LSB (q: 1111->1110->1100)\n- Each shift occurs as expected with proper timing\n\n4. Design vs. Implementation Mismatch:\n- The module name \"bad_loadable_shift\" suggests it should be a loadable shift register\n- The interface includes load and data inputs\n- However, the actual implementation ignores these sig",
