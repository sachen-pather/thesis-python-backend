- The change signal is mostly stuck at 0 during other transitions where change should potentially be given.

2. State Transition Issues:
- At time 25000, after accumulating 20 cents (three 10-cent coins/2'b10), the machine enters state 4 (S20)
- At 35000, another 10-cent coin causes dispense but doesn't give change when it should (accumulated 30 cents for a 25-cent item)

3. Behavioral Inconsistencies:
- The machine sometimes dispenses without giving correct change
- State transitions appear to skip expected intermediate states in some cases
- The change signal only activates once in the entire sequence at 75000, suggesting the change calculation logic is likely incomplete
