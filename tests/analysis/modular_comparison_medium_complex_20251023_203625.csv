  * in=2 → out=0100
  * in=3 → out=1000

2. Enable Signal Issue:
- At timestamp 40000, enable goes LOW (0), but the output continues to decode
- The output changes to 0100 when in=2 despite enable being inactive
- A proper decoder should typically disable its outputs (all zeros or high-impedance) when enable is LOW

3. Missing Implementation:
- The Verilog code doesn't include any logic for the enable signal in the always block
- The case statement runs regardless of the enable signal's state
- Should have been wrapped in an if(enable) condition

Suggested Fix:

- This happens AFTER count reaches 10, but we can't see the count transition
- The overflow timing seems delayed relative to when count hits 10

3. Reset Behavior:
- Reset (rst) transitions from 1 to 0 at 10000ns
- However, we don't see the expected initialization of count to 0 during or after reset
- Count remains undefined after reset instead of starting from 0

Expected Behavior Should Be:
- Count should be visible and increment from 0 to 10 cyclically
- When count hits 10, overflow should assert in the same cycle
- After reset, count should be clearly 0
- All signal transitions should be visible

This subtractor circuit has several significant issues:

1. Borrow Signal Issue:
- The borrow signal is hardcoded to 0 (assign borrow = 1'b0;) in the design
- This is incorrect for a subtractor as borrow should be 1 when a < b
- This will cause incorrect results for cases where borrowing is needed

2. Input/Output Behavior:
- Many input values (a and b) are shown as undefined/uninitialized (blank in the waveform)
- Despite undefined inputs, the difference output shows specific values (14, 11)
- This is logically inconsistent - outputs should be undefined when inputs are undefined

3. Subtractor Implementation:
- The simple assign diff = a - b; without proper borrow handling is insufficient
- A proper 4-bit subtractor should implement: diff = a - b - borrow_in
- Current implementation will give incorrect results for cases requiring borrowing

4. Test Coverage:
- The waveform shows very limited test cases
- Only one clear input value is shown (a=15 at 20000ns)

The Verilog simulation waveform data reveals several anomalies in the behavior of the ""bad_traffic_light"" circuit:

1. **Emergency Handling Anomaly:**
   - At timestamp 210000, the `emerg` signal is set to 1, indicating an emergency. The expected behavior during an emergency is for both `ns_light` and `ew_light` to be set to RED (00).
   - The waveform data shows that `ns` is initially 10 (GREEN) at 210000 and only changes to 00 (RED) at 215000. This suggests a delay or incorrect handling of the emergency condition since `ns_light` should immediately switch to RED when `emerg` becomes 1.

2. **State Transition Anomaly:**
   - The design code indicates that the state `S_NS_GREEN` should never transition to `S_NS_YELLOW` due to a bug. This means `ns_light` should remain GREEN (10), and `ew_light` should remain RED (00) until an emergency occurs or another state change condition is met.
   - The waveform data shows that `ns` changes from 10 to 00 at timestamp 215000 ev",1.5,9.808245182037354,11.308245182037354

  * When emergency goes low at t=230000, the circuit returns to its previous state
- This part of the functionality works as intended

3. Counter Issues:
- The counter signal is not visible in the waveform
- Given that the state never changes, this suggests the counter isn't effectively controlling state transitions

4. Primary Bug:
- In the S_NS_GREEN state case, there's no condition to check the counter and transition to S_NS_YE",1.5,7.0221288204193115,8.522128820419312

- The zero flag (Z) remains stuck at 0 throughout all operations
- This is due to the explicit bug in the code: `zero = 1'b0; // BUG: Always 0`
- The flag should be 1 when result == 0, which happens in several operations (like at 10000ns and 20000ns)

2. Incorrect Results:
- At 20000ns: ADD operation (op=000) with a=ff + b=01 
  - Should overflow to 0x00 with carry=1 (carry is correct, but result shows 00)
  - The waveform shows this correctly but should set Z=1 since result is 0

3. Logical Operations:
- At 30000ns: AND operation (op=010) with a=aa & b=55
  - Result shows 00 which is incorrect
  - The correct result should be 0x00 (AND of alternating bits)
  - Zero flag should be 1 here but remains 0

4. Shift Operation:
- At 40000ns: Right shift (op=111) with a=80
  - Shows result=40 which is correct (0x80 >> 1 = 0x40)
  - But carry flag handling for shifts is not properly defined in",1.5,7.103864431381226,8.603864431381226
